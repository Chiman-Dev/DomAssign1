		<p id="para1">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a
			programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that
			programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
			the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to
			the page.</p>
		<p id="para2">A Web page is a document. This document
			can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same
			document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same
			document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of
			the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.</p>
